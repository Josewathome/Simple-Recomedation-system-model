# RECOMEDATION SYSTEM #
*Content Based Recomendation system*
this are systems that help custumers by predidcting what they are looking for by looking at past likings.
in this type of recomendations we need to create a profile for each item which represents the properties of those items. the user profiles are inferred for 
a particular user. we will use these profiles to recomend items to the users from the cata log.

Example , if the movie is an Item then its actors, director, release year and genre are its important properties. and for the document, the important
 property is the type of content and set of important words in it.

#Lets Create an item profile#
first we need to perform the TF-IDF vectorizer, here TF(TERM FREQUENCY) of a word is the number of times it appears in a document and the IDF (inverse 
document Frequency) of a word is the measure of how significant that term is in the whole document.

During the creation of the users profile we use a utility matrix that describes the relationship between user and item. from this information the best 
estimate we can decide which item the user likes, is some aggregation of the profiles of those items.

#COLLABORATIVE FILTERING#
This is based on the ideathat similar people(based on the data) generally tend to like similar things. By this it predicts which item a user will like 
based on the item preferences
It uses a user-item matrix to generate recomendations. this matrix contains the values that indicate a users preference towards a given item.


#IN CONCLUSION#

In conclusion, developing a Python recommendation system allows for the creation of tailored content recommendations that improve user experience and take 
into account user preferences. Through the utilization of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid techniques, these systems are able 
to offer customized recommendations to consumers for content, movies, or items. These systems use sophisticated methods such as closest neighbors and 
matrix factorization to find hidden patterns in item attributes and user behavior. Recommendation systems are able to adjust and get better over time 
thanks to the combination of machine learning and data-driven insights. In the end, these solutions are essential for raising consumer satisfaction, 
improving user engagement, and propelling corporate expansion in a variety of industries.
